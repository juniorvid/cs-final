Scores/analysis for sports teams

http://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/basketball/nba/teams for gathering data, add a / + abbreviation for the team
to access team stats, but not needed.

5/10 Update: Added the base Java file, the ESPN API and the json API. The file currently reads the ESPN json data and prints basketball.
